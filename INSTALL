To compile Gargoyle you will need jam 2.5.

For sound support, you will need SDL_mixer.
The FMOD sound support is slightly broken, but can be re-enabled
with a little bit of hacking.

Edit the Jamrules file to suit your system configuration.
Comment out the "USESDL = yes" line if you don't care about
sound support.

Compile with "jam". The default is to build a RELEASE build.

Compile with "jam -sBUILD=DEBUG" for a debuggable build.

The command "jam install" will copy the compiled executables
and shared libraries into "build/dist/".

For a system-wide install, the following four steps should place
the binaries, shared library, and configuration file in appropriate
locations. However, please check the Jamrules file and verify that
the referenced paths actually exist before you proceed.

sudo env SYSTEM=1 jam install
sudo ln -s -f /usr/local/libexec/gargoyle/gargoyle /usr/local/bin/gargoyle
sudo ln -s -f /usr/local/lib/gargoyle/libgarglk.so /usr/lib/libgarglk.so
sudo cp garglk/garglk.ini /etc/garglk.ini
