To compile Gargoyle you will need jam 2.5.

For sound support, you will need SDL_mixer.
The FMOD sound support is slightly broken, but can be re-enabled
with a little bit of hacking.

Edit the Jamrules file to suit your system configuration.
Comment out the "USESDL = yes" line if you don't care about
sound support.

Compile with "jam". The default is to build a RELEASE build.

Compile with "jam -sBUILD=DEBUG" for a debuggable build.

The command "jam install" will copy the compiled executables
and shared libraries into "build/dist/".
