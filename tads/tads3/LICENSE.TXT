TADS 3 FREEWARE SOURCE CODE LICENSE

The TADS 3 source code is Copyright 1998, 2010 by Michael J. Roberts.

The author hereby grants you permission to use, copy, and distribute
this software, if you agree to the following conditions:

    1. You must include this license and the copyright notice with
       all copies.
    2. You may not require or collect a fee for copies of this
       software, or any part of this software, that you give to
       other people.
    3. You may not include this software with any other software

    4. You may not modify this software except as permitted below

       you originally received.
    5. Anyone to whom you give a copy of this software receives

Derivative Works
----------------

This source code is distributed for the specific purpose of porting
TADS, so that you can run the software on any system of your choosing.
All other derivative works are prohibited without the written
permission of the author.  I want to avoid the creation of variations
on the system, because it leads to confusion on the part of users if
there are multiple incompatible flavors floating around.  However, if
you have a specific idea in mind, I'd be happy to at least consider
it.  Please contact the author if you have any questions about this or
if you would like permission to create a derived work.  

If you port TADS to a new platform, the author does grant permission
for you to distribute your ported version - I encourage it, in fact.
I ask that you include your contact information in any distribution
package you create, so that users of your version will know how to
contact you if they have any questions relating specifically to your
version.
